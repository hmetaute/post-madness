Welcome to Post Madness!!
============

You're seeing the simplest CRUD app ever written.
This is a demo app uses Node.js at the back end and Angular.js at the front end.
The files are then divided into node.js configuration files and angular.js code files.

Node.js
============
The files serving node.js are: 
package.json which contains the node dependencies
backend.js which contains the back end server code

Angular.js
===========
There is only one file serving angular.js client code and mvn model

Feel free to toy with the code and to use it as a start point to more complex solutions
